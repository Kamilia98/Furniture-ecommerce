        Your receipt and the itemâ€™s original packaging are required for all
        returns and exchanges. We issue refunds through the same method of
        payment as the original payment (e.g. credit card purchases will be
        credited to the original credit card account).

      <p>
        If you are not entirely satisfied with your purchase, simply return the
        unopened item within 90 days with your receipt in-store. We will refund
        the price you paid for the goods and credit the refund amount to your
        credit/account that you made payment with. We will not refund any
        delivery and assembly costs you have paid in case you requested to
        return goods already delivered to your home. And based on our evaluation
        of item condition we will refund the product value.
